#  RSA-2048 Encryption Chat Demo

## Overview

This project is a visual web-based demonstration of **RSA-2048 encryption and decryption** using Python, Flask, and PyCryptodome. The application allows two users, Alice and Bob, to generate RSA key pairs, exchange encrypted messages, and decrypt them interactively via a modern web interface—mirroring basic secure chat functionality.

##  Features

- RSA-2048 key pair generation for both users.
- Public key encryption of messages and private key decryption.
- Real-time chat interface: send, view, and decrypt messages visually (click-to-decrypt).
- Modular Python backend (separate files for encryption, decryption, main logic, and web server).
- Clean, responsive frontend (HTML/CSS/JavaScript).
- Educational walkthrough: each message shows both ciphertext (Base64) and the decrypted plaintext.
